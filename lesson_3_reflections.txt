When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You would want to use a remote repository to share your work and collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
 You may have changes on a branch in your repository that you want to push the the remote
 repository. In this case, you wouldn't want the remote repository automatically updating
 your local repository.
