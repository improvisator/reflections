When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You would want to use a remote repository to share your work and collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
 You may have changes on a branch in your repository that you want to push the the remote
 repository. In this case, you wouldn't want the remote repository automatically updating
 your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 A fork is used to create a copy of a repository to then modify independently on github.
 -> If I want a copy to work collaborate on without affecting the original.
 A clone is used to create a copy of a repository locally or between github and locally.
 -> If I want a copy to work on myself without affecting the original (or if I don't have permission)
 A branch is within a repository - either locally or on github.
 -> To make changes to a file in a repository (maintaining a history linkage, of course)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 It enables you to diff and to merge the commits between the two.
