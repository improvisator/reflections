What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it creates an empty .git directory repository.
The .git directory with everything in it to 'start' a repository.
You need to do this as a starting point for starting version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area groups together files that will be used in a single 'commit'.
This allows a change that spans multiple files to be committed in one commit.
