What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it creates an empty .git directory repository.
The .git directory with everything in it to 'start' a repository.
You need to do this as a starting point for starting version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area groups together files that will be used in a single 'commit'.
This allows a change that spans multiple files to be committed in one commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?

Some situations when branches would be helpful...saving a production release separate from the
version being worked on for the next set of features. This way, if fixes are needed on the
production version, you can make them 'just there' and then make a patch release.
Branches would also be useful for experimenting on different features, and/or allowing engineers
in multiple groups to create their own path.
In both cases, branches would help to label which-is-which.
